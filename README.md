# Anderson power distribution

This is PCB designs for power distribution boards that use Anderson PowerPole 45-amp connectors.

See the board-to-wire connector [drawings](https://www.andersonpower.com/content/dam/app/ecommerce/product-pdfs/PP1545/b02021s.pdf). These designs use the `1335G1` (straight) and `1336G1` (right-angle) parts.
